### Description

A fine tuned RetinaNet model with a ResNet-50 backbone trained to identify 16 midwater classes. The 29,327 training images were collected in Monterey Bay by a two imaging systems developed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.  The monochrome and 3-channel color images contain a total of 34,071 localizations that were split into 90/10 train/validation sets. The full set of images will be loaded into FathomNet and a list of persistent URLs will be added to a future version of this repository.
